# ML-Based Transistor Power Prediction

## üß† Objective
Built a machine learning model to predict gate-level power consumption from RTL designs using data extracted from Synopsys tools.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- Synopsys Design Compiler (for RTL data generation)

## ‚ú® Key Learnings
- Applying ML techniques to hardware design problems
- Feature extraction from RTL-level data
- Energy efficiency and early-stage optimization
