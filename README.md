# Becoming a Verification Engineer

Hello! üëã I'm Venkata Shanmukha Sri Sudha Renduchintala.

I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Florida, specializing in Digital Design and Hardware Verification.  
With a CGPA of 3.74/4, coursework in VLSI, Reconfigurable Computing, and Hardware Security, and hands-on project experience, I am passionate about building the skills needed to become a Verification Engineer.

This repository documents my learning journey, projects, and certifications as I work towards my goal.

## üõ†Ô∏è What This Repository Covers

Here, I document projects that have helped me grow my verification knowledge:

- **AXI and UART Protocol Verification** using UVM
- **16-bit MIPS Processor Verification** using UVM and CRV/ABV
- **YAPP Protocol Router Verification** with IP-XACT RAL modeling
- **Formal Verification of AES-128** using JasperGold and Assertions
- **ML-Based Power Prediction** for RTL designs
- **High-Speed FPGA Accelerator Development**
- **Performance Analysis of CPU-GPU Architectures**

Each project was a stepping stone, helping me deepen my understanding of industry-standard verification flows.
